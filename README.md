# MLKitScanner
Proof of concept for MLKit Scanning features.

This project uses [MLKit](https://firebase.google.com/docs/ml-kit/read-barcodes) to read barcodes and QR codes. It also uses [CameraKit](https://github.com/CameraKit/camerakit-android) to wrap all camera related functions.
Since this uses Firebase to run this project you must generate a google-services.json file with the application 
package and place it in the app module folder, you can see more information on how to setup a Firebase project [here](https://firebase.google.com/docs/android/setup?hl=es-419).
